# attendance-tracker
Script to report attendance based off of cowbell connect attendace export

# Installation
While cloning this repo is an option, I would only recomennd it if contributing to the code is something you want to do. Otherwise, I would just download the source 'main.py' file into a location of your choosing.

# Usage
Launch attendace-tracker with the following command:

    $ main.py  input.csv

The 'input.csv' is the exported attendance records which can be downloaded on the specific event page in cowbell connect.
